  <p><pre> If it is true that the only paradises
  are those we have lost,
 I know what name to give the tender and inhuman something
 that dwells in me today. 
 
 An emigrant returns to his country. And I remember. 
 The irony and tension fade away, 
 and I am home once more. 
 I don't want to ruminate on happiness.  
 
 It is much simpler and much easier than that. 
 For what has remained untouched in these hours 
 I retrieve from the depths of forgetfulness
 is the memory of pure emotion,
 a moment suspended in eternity.
 
 Only this memory is true in me, and I always discover it too late. 
 
 We love the gentleness of 
 certain gestures, 
 the way a tree fits into a landscape. 
 
 And we have only one detail
 with which to recreate all this love, but it will do: 
 
 the smell of a room too long shut up, 
 the special sound of a footstep on the road. 
          
 This is the way it is for me.
 And if I loved then in giving myself, 
 
 I finally became myself, since only love restores us.</pre></p>
